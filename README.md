# Steele & Co

## This is a frontend website using HTML, JS, CSS and Bootstrap, based on my friendâ€™s company.
Preview Site: https://nolliebigheel.github.io/Steele-Co/SteeleAndCo/


### Why did I build this project?
* I built this project to show and practice my skills in HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap.
* Also I can use this as a future reference/ template for future projects.
* I built this for fun!

### What did I learn?
* As I am new to Bootstrap, it gave me a better understanding of its in built classes such as the container, rows and columns.
* There are many tools to help you like https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/. This helped me create the scroll animation for the content.
* I learnt how to use a linear-gradient overlay effect for my background images - background: linear-gradient(rgba(17, 7, 254, 0.7), rgba(0, 224, 254, 0.7));

### What can I do better in the future?
* For my next projects I will plan it out in more detail, especially with my .css file, so I do not write unnecessary/duplicate code.
* I should also spend more time on the design by utilizing https://www.figma.com/.

### Summary
Overall, I am proud of the outcome of this project by managing to display the content in the correct positions.
The more projects and practice I do, the closer I will be to becoming a full-stack Developer!
